Dear All

Apologies if this has been dealt with.  I've read the FAQ and the manual.

I running debian etch with libdvdcss.  When I run ogle I get the 
following output.  The GUI pops up, and when I select Open disc the 
screen window opens but stays black.  At the end I clicked on Exit.

n.b.: the line-end backslashes were added by me.

Any advice will be gratefully received.

I also had problems with the nvidia driver when upgrading to fc5.
It seems the xorg in fc5 loads its modules from another place,
so I had to manually copy the nvidia module from /usr/X11R6/lib64/modules/drivers/nvidia_drv.* to /usr/lib64/xorg/modules/drivers/
Don't know if this is the correct way but it worked.
Could be because I upgraded via the unsupported yum...

Use cvs if you are compiling yourself, it's more up to date.
Otherwise the above error is because program_name is declared twice with
different 'static'. This used to be a warning in gcc which is why it
made it into the release. ac3dec_wrap.c isn't used anyway.

Hard to say what is wrong.
Soundblaster live though seems to be one of the most problematic
cards to get spdif/ac3 output configured on.

Do you want ac3/5.1 output on spdif or just stereo on spdif?
How did you configure the audio in the oglerc?
You might want to try the cvs version of ogle which has some alsa
problems fixed.

This is probably a thing that is fixed in the cvs version.
So if you are not running the cvs version you can try to do the following.
Look for a Xv attribute named XV_AUTOPAINT_COLORKEY which probably is 0
It needs to be set to 1.
You can set it with:
xvattr -a XV_AUTOPAINT_COLORKEY -v 1
Then you should have picture in ogle.

Hi. I did a fresh install for FC5 (32bit), and the drivers are already 
in /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers. I've had the query on Fedoraforum for 2 
weeks, and the Fedora mailing list for a few days with no replies, but never 
mind. Hopefully it may get fixed by updates.

I had a similar problem with FC4 on the other machine with a cyberblade i1 
card using the trident driver. Had to change to the vesa one to get X to 
start, but after doing all the updates for FC4, was able to change back to 
the trident driver.

Anyway, Ogle seems to be working ok.

Ogle version 0.9.2-7.fc5  (from freshrpms)

Nigel.

Thanks for your help.  I didn't have xvattr installed! I just installed it (from debian-multimedia.org), and now ogle works fine!

Nice work, by the way.

best
