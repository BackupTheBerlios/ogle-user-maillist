Hi all,

I own two commercial DVD titles that make libdvdread return nonsense. I 
know it must be libdvdread, because all DVD player applications have 
trouble playing only these tho titles.

Running tcprobe on one of the DVD disks clearly shows what goes wrong:

takkie ~ # tcprobe -i /dev/dvd

The number of chapters on the title is correct, but the total playing time 
of 5 seconds is not. The running times and block indices of the chapters 
is total nonsense.

lsdvd does not show any information about the chapters. It outputs only 
this:

My version of libdvdread is libdvdread-0.9.4-r1 (Gentoo x86)

Is this a known problem or a new bug?

Cheers!

Hi,

I've spent several hours lately trying to work out why my dvd.iso file 
was not playing correctly in ogle, thinking it was a bug in my dvd.xml 
that I was feeding to dvdauthor.  Now having installed totem, I believe 
it to be a bug in ogle.


In ogle-0.9.2-r1 from Gentoo Portage:

When playing titleset 1 title 2, upon returning to the menu at the end 
of the video the buttons are completely invisible in ogle, although they 
work when you click in the appropriate empty space.  Pressing 'r' makes 
the buttons appear.  Titleset 1 titles 1 and 3 do not exhibit this 
issue, ie, when returning to the menu at the end of the video everything 
appears as it should be.


In totem-1.2.1 from Gentoo Portage:

Menus work without any problem.


Attached is my dvd.xml, in case that sheds any light on the matter, if 
you need me to debug I'll be happy to help, if you provide instructions.


Claude

What dvd is it (any extra copy protection schemes on it)?
Could you try with libdvdread-0.9.5 and see if it has been fixed?

There are some timing fixes in there that might solve this problem.

Hi,

Did you receive my reply to your message? It is not in the archives of the 
mailing list...

Anyway, there are two commercial DVD titles in my collection that make 
libdvdread go nuts, both from the same producer. The DVD titles contain 
archival footage of live performances of a Dutch rock band from the 
sixties. I guess the producer did not bother to add any special copy 
protection schemes because it is not a popular title or anything. Is there 
any way to check for copy protection schemes? Do copy protection schemes 
really prevent DVD players from properly reading the table of contents? 
That would sound strange to me.

I also tried upgrading to libdvdread 0.9.5, but I see the problem 
using that version.

Is there any way that I can extract interesting sections of the DVD and 
send it to the list for analysis?

Cheers,

Dik

No seems to have been some problems with the mailinglist I had to send the message 2 times before it got through.

Sony has some protectoin that adds bogus entries in the ifo files I think.
But this probably isn't that.

If play the dvd with ogle what problems do you have then?

What output do you get from ifo_dump ?

Could you put the .ifo files somewhere for download or email them?
