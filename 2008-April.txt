Subject: [Ogle-user] Ogle is stuck in windowed mode
Message-ID: <4814F886.6040407@armchair.mb.ca>

I can't seem to get ogle to go to fullscreen mode.  I have fullscreen 
set in oglerc and I've tried the 'f' key repeatedly.

The only messages I receive when playing a show is:
"
xscreensaver-command not found.
No accelerated IMDCT transform found
+msg close FIX
ctrl: ipc_rmid: Invalid argument
"

I'm using fluxbox on Gentoo using the proprietary Nvidia driver for an 
old GeForce2.  I'm using the composite out on the card.

I've been using mplayer for some time and it works in fullscreen just fine.

If you need more information, please let me know.

Thank you,
Richard
