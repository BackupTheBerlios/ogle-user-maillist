Ok, so I should file bugs with MPlayer, Transcode and lsdvd... I have 
one question regarding submitting these bug resports: Should it be 
possible for the developers of these projects to find the bug when they 
only have the IFO files? I know *nothing* about the libdvdread API, so 
maybe you can guess what will be needed to find the bugs.

Yes, I got that one.

&gt;<i> But from ifo_dump everything seems ok.

</I>
Ah, so an application needs to implement a DVD command interpreter in 
order to correctly determine the correct chapter positions?

Is there any way to see if a certain DVD uses dvd vm/navigation commands 
to define its structure?

So, If the problem is caused by MPlayer, Transcode and lsdvd not looking 
at the DVD commands, then I guess DVD titles that use dvd vm/navigation 
commands to define their structure are quite rare, because virtually any 
DVD 'works' prefectly with MPlayer, Transcode and lsdvd. Is that correct?

&gt;<i> Though they should still be able to list all the parts
</I>&gt;<i> (which they obviously do not do correctly in this case).
</I>
I am a bit confused here. I know about 'titles' and 'chapters', but I 
never heard about 'parts' before. What is a 'part' exactly?

Thanks,

Dik
