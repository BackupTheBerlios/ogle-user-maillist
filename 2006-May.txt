Subject: [Ogle-user] Install problem on FC5
Message-ID: <200605262348.23986.cave.dnb@tiscali.fr>

I have an Mplayer source install on FC1, and FC2 on this machine, and DVD's 
play ok. The DVD drive is on an IDE PCI adaptor card. Graphics card is a Rage 
128 PCI card using r128 driver.

FC5 has proved to be a different kettle of fish. Post install I had to change 
the graphics card driver to vesa, otherwise X would not start. The RPM for 
Mplayer from the Greysector repo installs, but I get 100% CPU, with juddery 
playback, and bursts of sound. The source tarball will not install, but as 
the Mplayer folks insist on certain versions of GCC, and FC5's gcc-4.1.0-3 
doesn't equate, this is probably no surprise, and I havn't bothered to 
contact them, as they don't want to know if you have steered away from the 
parameters they have set.

Next tried Totem, which is installed on FC5. No joy. Went to their site and 
installed libdvdcss RPM for FC5, but still no go. Complaints about missing 
plugins, although the DVD I was trying to play was showing on the menu.

Hey,

have you tried using the rpms (or better: the yum repo) from freshrpms?

RPMs for Fedora Core 5 (Bordeaux)
http://bordeaux.freshrpms.net/

You can install the yum repository by executing the following command as 
root:
 > rpm -Uvh 
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/fedora/linux/5/freshrpms-release/freshrpms-release-1.1-1.fc.noarch.rpm

after that, you call a
 > yum install ogle
and you should be good to go, since it solves all the dependany issues.

Enjoy,
benni.

Hi Lorenz. Thanks for the info about vesa and the CPU useage. That explains a 
lot. I'll post a question about it to the Fedora Forum. It may be a bug in 
FC5, as there are no problems with FC1,2, and 3, with r128 on the same 
machine.

Hi Benni. Thanks for the link to freshrpms for FC5. I may add the repo for 
freshrpms manually to Yum, as I have all the baseurls for planetccrma already 
set up there. I will still have to fix the r128 driver problem, but as you 
say, at least both Yum, And Apt solve the dependency problems.

I don't like dependency hell. It's not so bad when you know which development 
packages are required, and have easy access to them. The worst problem is 
with the compile, and make just stops, giving errors that you have no idea 
about.

Thanks again for the info. Nigel.
