How to play downloaded DVD files VIDEO_TS.IFO and VIDEO_TS.BUP?

To play a copied/ripped DVD with PowerDVD you click on the open button
and choose Open DVD File from the Hard Disk Drive and open the
video_ts.ifo.
--------------------------------------------------

Media Player Classic can play copied DVD by opening video_ts.ifo too
(with working DVD menu of couse).

Please, add this question in ogle FAQ even if it can't be solved
becouse this is crucial feature for most users and it need any mention.

Added.
Just open the directory where the IFO and VOB files are.
If IFO and VOB files are in /copy/of/disc/:
ogle /copy/of/disc
If the files are in a VIDEO_TS directory you can either specify
the VIDEO_TS directory or the parent.
